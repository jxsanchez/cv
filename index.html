                    <p>My name is Jesus and I am an aspiring full-stack web developer. I have previous coding experience in C++, Java, and Python, having earned an Associate of Science in Computer Science. I also have experience with web development concepts including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. I hope to take this course as a refresher but also as a means of learning other concepts that will make me more marketable as a web developer.</p>
